These charts try to answer these questions:

How do donations distribute across the globe? How much does each country receive and donate? Are there countries that are mostly receiving or donating? Where are they located? Do mostly receiving/donating countries tend to cluster around specific geographical areas?

How has the distribution of donations across the globe changed over time? Are there countries that became mostly donors after being receivers (or the other way around)?

Do certain type of disbursements tend to concentrate in some geographical areas (received)? Are there major differences in how different type of disbursements distribute geographically?
